# FileShare

FileShare is a simple and secure frontend application for anonymous file and text sharing.
Users can upload a single file, a piece of text, or both. After sharing, the app generates a 6-digit code that can be given to the receiver. Using this code, the receiver can retrieve the shared content. All shared data is automatically deleted after 24 hours, ensuring privacy and security.
